    <h2>Know About Architect!!</h2>
    <p>Walter Adolph Georg Gropius (18 May 1883 – 5 July 1969) was a German architect and founder of the Bauhaus School,
        who, along with Alvar Aalto, Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, Le Corbusier and Frank Lloyd Wright, is widely regarded
        as one of the pioneering masters of modernist architecture. Gropius was also a leading architect of the
        International Style.</p>
    <p>
        In 1910 Gropius left the firm of Behrens and together with fellow employee Adolf Meyer established a practice in
        Berlin. Together they share credit for one of the seminal modernist buildings created during this period: the
        Faguswerk in Alfeld-an-der-Leine, Germany, a shoe last factory. Although Gropius and Meyer only designed the
        facade, the glass curtain walls of this building demonstrated both the modernist principle that form reflects
        function and Gropius's concern with providing healthful conditions for the working class. The factory is now
        regarded as one of the crucial founding monuments of European modernism. Gropius was commissioned in 1913 to
        design a car for the Prussian Railroad Locomotive Works in Königsberg. This locomotive was unique and the first
        of its kind in Germany and perhaps in Europe. Other works of this early period include the office and factory
        building for the Werkbund Exhibition (1914) in Cologne.
    </p>
    <p>In 1913, Gropius published an article about "The Development of Industrial Buildings," which included about a
        dozen photographs of factories and grain elevators in North America. A very influential text, this article had a
        strong influence on other European modernists, including Le Corbusier and Erich Mendelsohn, both of whom
        reprinted Gropius's grain elevator pictures between 1920 and 1930.

        Gropius's career was interrupted by the outbreak of World War I in 1914. He was drafted August 1914 and served
        as a sergeant major at the Western front during the war years (getting wounded and almost killed) and then as
        a lieutenant in the signal corps. Gropius was awarded the Iron Cross twice ("when it still meant
        something," he confided to his friend Chester Nagel) after fighting for four years. Gropius then, like his
        father and his great-uncle Martin Gropius before him, became an architect.

    <p>
        Today, Gropius is remembered not only by his various buildings but also by the district of Gropiusstadt in
        Berlin. In the early 1990s, a series of books entitled The Walter Gropius Archive was published covering his
        entire architectural career. The CD audiobook Bauhaus Reviewed 1919–33 includes a lengthy English Language
        interview with Gropius.
