    <br>
    <p>Museum Island (German: Museumsinsel) is the name of the northern half of an island in the Spree river in the
        central Mitte district of Berlin, Germany, the site of the old city of Cölln. It is so-called for the complex of
        internationally significant museums, all part of the Berlin State Museums
        A first exhibition hall was erected in 1797 at the suggestion of the archaeologist Aloys Hirt. In 1822, Schinkel
        designed the plans for the Altes Museum to house the royal Antikensammlung, the arrangement of the collection
        was overseen by Wilhelm von Humboldt. The island, originally a residential area,
        was dedicated to "art and science" by King Frederick William IV of Prussia in 1841. Further extended under
        succeeding Prussian kings, the museum's collections of art and archeology were turned into a public foundation
        after 1918. They are today maintained by the Berlin State Museums branch of the Prussian Cultural Heritage
        Foundation.
    </p>
    <p>The Prussian collections became separated during the Cold War during the division of the city, but were reunited
        after German reunification,
        except for some art and artefacts removed after World War II by Allied troops. These include the Priam's
        Treasure, also called the gold of Troy,
        excavated by Heinrich Schliemann in 1873, then smuggled out of Turkey to Berlin and smuggled out of Germany to
        Moscow. Today it is kept at the Pushkin Museum in Moscow.
    </p>
    <p>
        As for the city's major museums, it took much of the 1990s for a consensus to emerge that Museum Island's
        buildings should be restored and modernized,
        with General Director Wolf-Dieter Dube's cautious plan for their use finally approved in January 1999.
        Then, six months later, Peter-Klaus Schuster took over and set in motion a far more ambitious program intended
        to turn Museum Island into a Louvre on the Spree.
        The federal government pledged $20 million a year through 2010 for projects to enhance Berlin's prestige and
        Unesco declaring the island a World Heritage Site.
    </p>
    <p>The contents of the museums were decided on as follows: The Pergamon, with the Greek altar that gives it its
        name,
        retained much of its collection and was defined as a museum of ancient architecture. The Neues Museum presented
        archaeological objects as well as Egyptian and Etruscan sculptures,
        including the renowned bust of Queen Nefertiti. The Altes Museum, the oldest on the island, displayed Greek and
        Roman art objects on its first floor and hold exhibitions on its second floor. The Bode Museum's paintings went
        from Late Byzantine to 1800.
        And, as now, the Alte Nationalgalerie will cover the 19th century. Once this process is completed, perhaps by
        2020, the Gemäldegalerie’s painting collection will be transferred to the Bode, and a new annex, and Museum
        Island will present all art from the ancient civilizations to 1900. The James Simon Gallery, a $94 million
        visitors’ center designed by the British architect David Chipperfield, is being built beside the Neues Museum.
        It will in turn be linked to the Neues, Altes, Pergamon and Bode Museums by an underground passageway decorated
        with archaeological objects.
    </p>
    <p>
        Once the Museum Island Master Plan is completed, the so-called Archaeological Promenade will connect four of the
        five museums in the Museum Island. The Promenade will begin at the Old Museum in the south, lead through the New
        Museum and the Pergamon Museum and end at the Bode Museum, located at the northern tip of the Island. Before
        World War II, these museums were connected by bridge passages above ground; they were destroyed due to the
        effects of the war. There have never been plans to rebuild them; instead, the central courts of individual
        museums will be lowered, which has already been done in the Bode Museum and in the New Museum. They will be
        connected by subterranean galleries. In a way, this archaeological promenade can be regarded as the sixth museum
        in the Island, because it is devised not only as a connecting corridor but also as a strung-out exhibition room
        for interdisciplinary presentations. The Archaeological Promenade may be characterized as a cross-total of the
        collections that are shown separately (in accordance with cultural regions, epochs, and art genres) in the
        individual museums of the Island. The Archaeological Promenade will address multi-focus topics that have
        occupied the human mind irrespective of time and cultural region, be it a question of life after death or issues
        of beauty and other topics. Museum Island is referenced in the song "On the Museum Island" by folk artist Emmy
        the Great.

        The southern section of the island, south of Gertraudenstrabe, is commonly referred to as Fischerinsel (Fisher
        Island) and is the site of a high-rise apartment development built when Mitte was part of East Berlin.
